This project is my first Vue.js e-comerce project.
I am using stripe, MailTrap and connected to heroku which embed a Node.js file as a backend.
Not using database for now, but just a Json file.
MailTrap cannot send emails as I am using it as a Free version.
You can view the project as a client at : https://redcode456123.github.io/Vue.js-Practice-examples/#/

This is a prototype, some bugs may still exist.
Models may not refer to actual images.

Hope you like it.
Any comments are welcomed by email to: naim.rach@gmail.com.

Thanks.
